# Chiron - AI Mock Interview Assistant

## Inspiration
The conception of Chiron, the AI mock interview assistant, was ignited by the profound capabilities of groundbreaking AI technologies such as GPT-4 and Gemini. Marveled by the transformative impact these AI tools can have on professional development, we embarked on a journey to devise a tool that personalizes the job interview preparation process, capitalizing on individual experiences and career goals.

## What Chiron Does
Chiron stands as a beacon for job seekers, offering a cutting-edge AI-driven mock interview experience tailored to your resume and desired job role. It not only allows you to explore job opportunities with its advanced search capabilities but also critically assesses your interview performance, providing valuable feedback on both your answers and emotional engagement.

## How We Built It
Our toolkit is an amalgam of modern software technologies. Key functionalities are brought to life with libraries such as `face-api.js`, `react-pdf`, and `react-speech-recognition`. We leveraged the Adzuna Job Search API for job indexing and Firebase for user authentication and database services. The core of Chiron—the question generation and interview grading—is powered by OpenAI's API.

## Challenges We Faced
In the whirlwind of our first hackathon, time management was our biggest hurdle. Integrating the face recognition video player was a complex feat, with latency issues adding to the challenge. Ambitious as we were, incorporating a LeetCode environment for technical interviews was a goal we unfortunately could not achieve within the time constraints.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
Conceiving and executing an application that seamlessly integrates multiple complex features within a mere 24-hour timeframe is our crowning achievement. We are particularly proud of our agility in turning ideas into fully-fledged functionalities, ensuring a balance between quality and efficiency.

## What We Learned
The sprint of this hackathon schooled us in rapid development cycles—right from ideation to deployment. We've become adept at making strategic decisions under pressure, evaluating trade-offs, and prioritizing feature implementation to meet critical deadlines.

## What's Next for Chiron
- Enhancing the video player to improve speed and reduce latency.
- Building a private search index for a customized question bank, augmenting OpenAI-generated questions.
- Refining OpenAI prompts to elicit even more precise interview questions.
- Elevating the user interface for an unmatched user experience.
